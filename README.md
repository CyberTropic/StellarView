# StarFinder
Setup:\
in Visual Studio Code, run the following commands\
npm install -g nodemon\
npm install express\
npm install morgan\
npm install sql\
npm install body-parser\

Install XAMPP, run MYSQL and APACHE\
go to: localhost/phpmyadmin\
create database (ask Dustin or Vlad for set-up information)\

We will be having the server hosted remotely for better usage, localhost phpmyadmin sucks\
