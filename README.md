# STELLARGAZE
Stellargaze is a web app which allowed users to quickly locate areas in which naked-eye star visibility is maximized.  Nearby parks are returned and given a score based on 1) moon phase, 2) humidity, 3) cloud coverage, and 4) light pollution value.  Users can then review, report, and get directions to such parks.  Happy stellargazing!
